### Introduction
This repository provides the Python implementation of our AAMAS 2021 paper titled `A privacy-preserving and accountable multiagent
learning framework`

In this project, we implement federated learning in which clients can share the  model updates under topology structure such as tree, chain, or ring. We compare the training time, bandwidth and accuracy for each topology structure.
